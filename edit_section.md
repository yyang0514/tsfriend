# How to edit section #



1. { means sub body start

2. } means sub body end

3. # means comment, like \\ in C++

4. field define format as bellow:

> field\_name: field\_lenth: field\_value

field\_name dosen't mean's a lot here, only "section\_length" and "length" are used for check if format length ok.
field\_lenth is length in bit of this field.
field\_value is value in hex format.


**note**: the total length inside {} must be correct, same as "length" field plus head length.
